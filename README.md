# DC Speaking Proposals

Do you want to speak at a DC meetup? How about find a speaker for your meetup? You're in the right place!

There are a lot of talks that would be awesome for multiple meetups in DC, and it's difficult to pitch to all of them at once right now. Organizers are always looking for speakers. This repository bridges that gap by allowing speakers to pitch their talks to a bunch of meetups all at once.

## Speakers

Please [fill out an issue](https://github.com/dctech/cfps/issues/new) with information about your proposed talk. There's a template with some questions to answer about your talk within that issue. Feel free to skip any you don't feel comfortable answering. Also, add labels to the issue so your talk is easier to find.

Also, take a look at issues labeled [wanted](https://github.com/dctech/speaking/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Awanted), you might be able to find an idea for a talk that is desired, but does not have anyone to give it yet.

## Community

Please [fill out an issue](https://github.com/dctech/cfps/issues/new) with information on a talk suggestion! There's a template with some question to answer about the talk you want to have given.
